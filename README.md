OneGrayLady is a greasemonkey script that puts any New York Times
(_The Gray Lady_) article into single page mode.

This is a shoutout to my favorite newspaper of record.  I'd be lost
without you.

To install the script, [click here](https://github.com/marcua/onegraylady/raw/master/onegraylady.user.js).

I've only tested this in Google Chrome.  Send smoke signals if things
don't work for you.
